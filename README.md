Neom Token Whitepaper

History

Neom (styled NEOM; Arabic: نيوم, romanized: Niyūm, Hejazi Arabic pronunciation: [nɪˈjo̞ːm]) is a new urban area planned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to be built in its northwestern Tabuk Province to be the Kingdom's pint-sized, free-market answer to China. The site is north of the Red Sea, east of Egypt across the Gulf of Aqaba and south of Jordan. The total planned area of Neom is 26,500 km2 (10,200 sq mi). The city's plans include multiple regions, including a floating industrial complex, global trade hub, tourist resorts and a linear city powered by renewable energy sources.[2] It was launched by Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.
Developers intend for the majority of the city to be completed by 2039.[3] Experts have expressed skepticism about the ambitions of the megaproject.[4] Saudi Arabia originally aimed to complete major parts of the project by 2020, with an expansion completed in 2025, but then fell behind schedule.[5][6] By July 2022, only two buildings had been constructed, and most of the project area remained bare desert.[6]
The project's estimated cost exceeds $500 billion.[7] On January 29, 2019, the Saudi government announced that it had established a closed joint-stock company named Neom.[8] The company is wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund and is solely dedicated to developing the economic zone of Neom

Salman announced plans for the city at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh on October 24, 2017.[13] He said that it would operate independently from the “existing governmental framework” with its own tax and labour laws and an "autonomous judicial system."[14] Egypt announced in 2018 that it would contribute some land to the Neom project.[15]
Klaus Kleinfeld was announced by Salman as the inaugural director for the Neom project upon its launch.[16] In 2018, Kleinfeld signed Gladstone Place Partners LLC to handle communications services for the Neom project for a fee of $199,500 plus expenses of $45,000.[17][18] Kleinfeld was then announced as an advisor to bin Salman and Nadhmi Al-Nasr as the director of Neom.[16]
The initiative to create the city of Neom emerged from Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversify its economy and develop public-service sectors.[19] Plans call for robots to perform functions such as security, logistics, home delivery and caregiving[20] and for the city to be powered solely with wind and solar power.[14] The first phase of the project is scheduled for completion by 2025, and in 2024 tourists will begin to visit.[21][22] The project planned to raise up to 3 billion riyals from local banks to fund the development of Sindalah Island, a luxury tourism development.[23]
